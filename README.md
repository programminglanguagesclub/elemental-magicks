#### **elemental-magicks** <br />
 Idris + Ur/Web development of a perfect information, fair, deterministic turn based strategy game, built with dependent types!


#### **Intro** <br />
 Elemental Magicks is the first game to be entirely skill based in the following sense:
 Given any legal position (not just the starting position),
any strategy S from that position which is not mini-max cannot possibly
achieve an inferior result if a decision in S is substituted from the mini-max strategy to replace a non-minimax optimal decision in S.
 That is to say, all minimax strategies is guaranteed to be best,
Except for some cases where a strategy which is not mini-max in positions which are not reached,
and mini-max (but could be a different mini-max decision) in cases which are reached.
 It is thus more pure as a strategy game even than chess, and much more than other games of its genre.

#### **OurGoal** <br />
 Having successfully prototyped this game in Java (about 100,000 line development),
we seek to build a beautiful, concise, and robust version using the best programming languages currently available.
 That means development in Ur/Web and Idris.

We're the programming languages club from the University of Oregon.

We have weekly meetings where we discuss design patterns and type systems.

We also work on group projects,
designed to give us experience in powerful languages,
and provide examples of powerful languages in action.

On the buttons for Banished, Graveyard, Hand, it should indicate how many cards are in each with a little number by the button.
Should resize the text in the message area to match the size of the window.
Should stop using Three.js in favor of a mixture of normal HTML, CSS3, and canvas objects.
I can do whatever effects I want with canvas just fine, and this will make the code much much much MUCH easier to work with.

I need to rewrite my sphere effects (like fire).

I need to work out my click events so that if the upper left of the cursor is on my object then the click is registered.
This should work out fine if I use html.

Animate victory overlay with continue to next round / return to arena stuff,
and also show rating update!


When I remake my front-end, I want to follow essentially the same format as the version 3,
although I should also look at the version 2.

I need to make sure I can scroll in the hand/graveyard/banished areas like I could in version 1 (and maybe 2).
